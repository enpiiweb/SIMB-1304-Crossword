					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Review of AxWord by Derek Harrison of The Crossword Centre (UK) 21 March 2002:</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">&quot;I have been having lots of fun trying out AxWord for Windows. This software is rather idiosyncratic at first but it certainly does work. AxWord comes with three main components. The Word Finder is a sophisticated search engine which uses an extensive word list, including many phrases and proper nouns. It has lots of search options. My favourite is the fuzzy search, where you think that one of the letters may be incorrect. For example a search for B.GLER will find bangles, bragger, brawler, burglar etc. The rotary search can find all words that fit a given string treated as a loop, both forward and backward. So a search for G.O.I. would find (inter alia) geodic, boxing, gingko, etc. A nice feature is that you can restrict a search using the Filter option. You can look for a word that is only in the list of Mythology, Science, Places etc. This part of the programme is very fast and I liked it a lot.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The second main feature of AxWord is the Crossword Grid Editor. You can design any sort of grid, print and save. When compiling a puzzle you also have the use of the search facility to help you fill it. Here the dual search is very useful as it will give you an option of words that will match both your across and down entry. I am sure that I shall use this a lot.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The third use of AxWord is its special functions, a Scrabble Scorer, Cryptograms and an Acrostic Compiler. To be honest, I need to practise a bit to use these properly, although AxWord comes with an extensive and easy handbook. The Classical roots function is truly fascinating. You can use it to explain a word with Latin or Greek elements. Enter SCELOSTENOSIS and it will explain it as leg-narrowing. A crazy example, maybe, but I know that the Synthesize function has been used to name recently discovered species. For example, if you had found a brightly-coloured bird you could name it PHOTONORNIS, or NITIAVIS, if you preferred the Latin.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">AxWord is reasonably priced at 50 Australian dollars and you can find out more from its designer Doug Butler at <a href="mailto:d.butler@internode.on.net">d.butler@internode.on.net</a>&quot;</font></p>
