					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Catherine's childhood was spent in various parts of South Queensland. She went to school at St Hilda's in Southport where she first took an interest in crosswords. With her friend they would snaffle the class newspaper and do the crossword instead of prep. Catherine says: &quot;Maybe that misspent youth accounts for a lot of things!&quot; In 1950 she went to work at RBH as a lab technician. After marriage and a couple of years in Canberra she returned to Brisbane with a baby son and eventually acquired a daughter and another son. By 1968 when she returned to work in a private pathology lab, the daily papers were publishing English cryptics. Catherine was hooked and managed to spread her addiction to several others (like all good pushers!). With the help of the lab photocopier they would try to beat each other to finish the day's puzzle. In 1980 her daughter was doing some work for a new paper TIME OFF. She suggested that Catherine compose cryptics for it. Catherine was horrified but managed some simple ones. At $10 a puzzle she didn't see it as a career move! Soon after she retired from the lab in 1989 a journalist friend decided that composing cryptics was exceedingly clever (Catherine was not about to disillusion her!). Her piece appeared in the Sunday Mail and she was contacted by several Brisbane members including Shirl O'Brien. Catherine immediately joined the Australian Crossword Club and the rest, as they say, is history.</font></p>
