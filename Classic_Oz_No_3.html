<B>1&nbsp;</B>Wyatt Earp dreamt at OK Corral of becoming an Aussie Digger (7)<BR>
<B>5&nbsp;</B>to get back his reputation as a miracle man, (7)<BR>
<B>9&nbsp;</B>whenever it might be vital for him to fix things. (5)<BR>
<B>10&nbsp;</B>Doc Holliday, a clever sick man, loathed all nonconformists, (9)<BR>
<B>11&nbsp;</B>killers and rustlers, who took commissions. (7)<BR>
<B>12&nbsp;</B>He fought the Clanton rebels to bring peace to Tombstone and make the world safe for seafood. (7)<BR>
<B>13&nbsp;</B>The wild Clanton bunch estimated the townsfolk would kick up a stink. (6)<BR>
<B>15&nbsp;</B>Thinking their force barely adequate for the coming struggle, (8)<BR>
<B>17&nbsp;</B>they would cloud main issue by avoiding any area of soft earth (3)<BR>
<B>18&nbsp;</B>and fight in the corral, as pumping rifles would afford little advantage in the long grass (8)<BR>
<B>19&nbsp;</B>Amongst the Earps, Virgil, a maniac in some respects, behaved like a beast, (6)<BR>
<B>22&nbsp;</B>fighting in dispirited, tasteless fashion, (7)<BR>
<B>24&nbsp;</B>which was very optimistic of him, considering his lack of purpose. (7)<BR>
<B>26&nbsp;</B>Dropping one Clanton, Doc turned on another outlined against the rising sun, (9)<BR>
<B>27&nbsp;</B>put nine rifle shots into him, which brought on much internal disorder, (5)<BR>
<B>28&nbsp;</B>and cut across, sick as he was, (7)<BR>
<B>29&nbsp;</B>to plug the direct exit from being settled. (7)<BR>

<B>1&nbsp;</B>Wonder of wonders!  Wyatt heard one revolver slam into the dust (7)<BR>
<B>2&nbsp;</B>and saw the hotel-keepers present various spectators with binoculars (9)<BR>
<B>3&nbsp;</B>to watch the Clanton efforts fail over and over again. (5)<BR>
<B>4&nbsp;</B>Fermented mare's milk (skim) ushered in the celebrations (6)<BR>
<B>5&nbsp;</B>when Doc's old verve revived as the tide of battle turned. (8)<BR>
<B>6&nbsp;</B>Behind a slab cabin. Earp picked off another of the Clantons. who were now all at sea, (9)<BR>
<B>7&nbsp;</B>while, on the turf, village folk removed their coats (5)<BR>
<B>8&nbsp;</B>and shaded eyes against the wind as the last rimfire bullet whistled by. (7)<BR>
<B>14&nbsp;</B>The defenders could now march in as moppers-up, with confidence (9)<BR>
<B>15&nbsp;</B>combined with the maximum courage of fearless men. (3)<BR>
<B>16&nbsp;</B>The last word meant brushing off one inquisitive painter (9)<BR>
<B>17&nbsp;</B>and a farmer due, regrettably, to be hanged as one with homicidal tendencies (8)<BR>
<B>18&nbsp;</B>Peace in spring-time had been restored by those of the highest rank (7)<BR>
<B>20&nbsp;</B>while in Boot Hill yard, eerie forms were laid flat. (7)<BR>
<B>21&nbsp;</B>Later, having a rest in the billiards hall: &quot;The man who takes us on,&quot; said Earp, &quot;dies!&quot; (6)<BR>
<B>23&nbsp;</B>&quot;Doc is in a bad way,&quot; cried Virgil.  &quot;Mount up!&quot; (5)<BR>
<B>25&nbsp;</B>Bringing the buggy in very fast, the victorious band whipped Doc off to the nearest doctor in contention (5)<BR>
