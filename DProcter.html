					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">DAVID PROCTER, keen solver of puzzles</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">David was born in Yorkshire in the year that England scored 903-7dec in a Test against Australia. (The Yorkshiremen scored over 600 of the runs but David was too young to appreciate it). David took an interest in crosswords and puzzles about 12 years of age when his parents won a week's holiday by sending in a crossword in a holiday magazine. They were sweating over whether SOL was the correct answer for SUN. David left school (Grammar) at age 16 to work on his father's farm before 5 years in the RAF doing equipment accounting. He migrated to Australia in 1964 and married Joy in 1966; they have two daughters and two grand-children. David accepted retrenchment in 1993 after 26 years' scheduling flights for TAA/Australian/Qantas. His sister Marian enrolled him as an ACC member in December 1990 (an excellent Xmas present). He prefers the tough Cryptics, Double Acrostics and Quizzes. </font></p>
