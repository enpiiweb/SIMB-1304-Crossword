					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">David Stickley, the former 'gridman' of the ACC, considers himself very lucky. After spending 12 years as a computer specialist in Sydney, he now works from home generating 13 crosswords a week for various newspapers and magazines. His wife, Linda, has recently left work to help him run the business which is growing steadily. David enjoys taking an active role in the raising of his children and, until recently, did most of the cooking and housework. David recently became the first Australian to have a cryptic crossword published in the New York Times. Looking ahead, David hopes that crosswords remain popular, especially among the younger generations who have many other things to distract them. To this end, he is developing an evening college course to teach people how to attempt cryptic crosswords.</font></p>
