Good on you Margaret for sharing your thoughts with us all. I feel that, in most endeavours, top achievers are rewarded - we can all endeavour to reach the top, but for myself the challenge of competing is most important. My congratulations and admiration for those who can so successfully do what I try really hard to do!!! You deserve your prizes. Like Alan Walter I think the 1 to 5 arrangement of random draw from correct entries is the only way to go, but I also think that members should be eligible for the prize for each 1 to 5 puzzle only once in each year. There is still the incentive, as a member could win five prizes in each year. My ambition is to get five ticks one month. The only time I have done this is when I was the adjudicator!!!!!!!! </b></font></csltb></p>

Here is my reply:  As a child living in Townsville, I was always told that the iron in the island made Cook's compass veer from true north and so he named the island Magnetic Island. </b><b><i>-Audrey Ryan </i></b></font></p>
