				<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">IAN WILLIAMS AM, Crossword and Puzzle Editor for the ACC.</font></b></p>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Ian started his crossword “career” with the (British) Daily Telegraph in the long past days when a valid cryptic clue was considered to be a quotation with a blank to indicate the required solution. He and Kay (keen long-lunchtime solvers) promoted themselves to the then Manchester Guardian, to the crosswords of which they have remained faithful (serendipitously via the Canberra Times) ever since. Araucaria is a particular favourite for his deviousness and ingenuity, although they share Shirl O’Brien’s respect for Custos and Rufus, both of whom encapsulate their clue construction within a meaningful surface reading in unbelievably few words. During his globe-trotting days for the Australian Government and as a private consultant in the field of maritime safety, crosswords saved his sanity while spending enormous amounts of time in the air, in airports and in hotels in far-away places.
						He started to handle e-lodged submissions to ACC competitions in 2005 and was invited by Patrick to take up the crossword editor’s role in 2006. In his retirement (what retirement?) he juggles these interests with solving, setting (mainly slot 6 and 7s – or slot 1 grids that may end up as a 6 or 7), and golf, as the handicapper and computer system manager of his club. Gardening comes a long way third.
