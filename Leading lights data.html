					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">PATRICK STREET, President and Foundation Member of the Australian Crossword Club.</font></b></p>
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Patrick has been involved with crosswords for many years. His love affair with cryptics began in the 1960s. He joined Alan Eason's <i>Crossworder</i> magazine in 1988. He was a Foundation member of the Australian Crossword Club when it started in May 1990 and in February 1992 Patrick was privileged to be appointed by the Executive Committee the ACC President and has continued in that role for more than 20 years. He has contributed several crosswords to <i>Crozworld</i> mainly of an unorthodox nature. He took on the challenge of Adjudication of the Slots 1-5 puzzles for ten years. In June 2000 Patrick was appointed to the important role of editor and publisher of the ACC's monthly magazine <i>Crozworld</i> and has continued this essential undertaking since then. Patrick also carried out the role of Puzzle Set-up person for many years before passing the baton to the indispensable Ian Williams. The ACC is a thriving Club catering for theunique interests of cruciverbalists throughout Australia. The valued members of the ACC are dedicated solvers and lovers of crosswords and quizzes and it is hoped that <i>Crozworld</i> can continue to provide this essential service to the members of the ACC for many years into the future.</font>

					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">IAN WILLIAMS AM, Crossword and Puzzle Editor for the ACC.</font></b></p>
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Ian started his crossword 'career' with the (British) <em>Daily Telegraph</em> in the long past days when a valid cryptic clue was considered to be a quotation with a blank to indicate the required solution. He and Kay (keen long-lunchtime solvers) promoted themselves to the then Manchester <em>Guardian</em>, to the crosswords of which they have remained faithful (serendipitously via the <em>Canberra Times</em>) ever since. <em>Araucaria</em> is a particular favourite for his deviousness and ingenuity, although they share Shirl O'Brien's respect for <em>Custos</em> and <em>Rufus</em>, both of whom encapsulate their clue construction within a meaningful surface reading in unbelievably few words. During his globe-trotting days for the Australian Government and as a private consultant in the field of maritime safety, crosswords saved his sanity while spending enormous amounts of time in the air, in airports and in hotels in far-away places. He started to handle e-lodged submissions to ACC competitions in 2005 and was invited by Patrick to take up the crossword editor's role in 2006. In his retirement (what retirement?) he juggles these interests with solving, setting (mainly slot 6 and 7s or slot 1 grids that may end up as a 6 or 7), and golf, as the handicapper and computer system manager of his club. Gardening comes a long way third. </font>

					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">ALAN WALTER, Founder of the Australian Crossword Club.</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Alan has been solving crosswords since Primary School when he used to solve the orthodox crossword in the school magazine. Since then, Alan has not only solved countless crosswords but compiled a large number too. In 1984, he commenced compiling cryptics for the <em>Manly Daily</em>, the <em>Advocate</em> and the <em>Mosman Daily</em>. Academically, Alan has a B Sc (Syd.) and a Dip Ed (Syd Teachers' Coll) and was the Senior Head Teacher in Mathematics at the North Sydney College of TAFE at Gore Hill (NSW). Alan retired from that position in 2001 but has been acting as a part-time consultant teacher. Alan has made a valuable contribution to the Club and is well-recognised by crossworders for the work he has done in bringing the art and craft of the crossword to devotees throughout Australia.</font></p>

					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">BEV COCKBURN, Secretary/Treasurer of the Australian Crossword Club.</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Bev was born and bred in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney and educated at Kambala Girls School followed by a three-year teaching course at Sydney Kindergarten Teachers College at Waverley in Sydney. Apart from an eight year break to have her family, Bev taught non-stop until she retired in 1993. While teaching at Meriden Girls School at Strathfield she obtained her Bachelor of Education degree and a certificate in ESL (English as a Second Language). Since then, she has tutored classes with the U3A (University of the 3rd Age), done some part-time coaching and teaching of ESL and joined the ACC. Bev's aunt, Betty Wallace, introduced her to the club and later Bev was able to persuade her friend Steve Workman and her son Malcolm to join. Bev has been the distinguished Secretary/Treasurer of the ACC for many years, she has devised numerous puzzles and quizzes and has contributed so much to the cruciverbal art in Australia.</font>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>DAV</b></font><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">ID PROCTER, keen solver of puzzles</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">David was born in Yorkshire in the year that England scored 903-7dec in a Test against Australia. (The Yorkshiremen scored over 600 of the runs but David was too young to appreciate it). David took an interest in crosswords and puzzles about 12 years of age when his parents won a week's holiday by sending in a crossword in a holiday magazine. They were sweating over whether SOL was the correct answer for SUN. David left school (Grammar) at age 16 to work on his father's farm before 5 years in the RAF doing equipment accounting. He migrated to Australia in 1964 and married Joy in 1966; they have two daughters and two grand-children. David accepted retrenchment in 1993 after 26 years' scheduling flights for TAA/Australian/Qantas. His sister Marian enrolled him as an ACC member in December 1990 (an excellent Xmas present). He prefers the tough Cryptics, Double Acrostics and Quizzes. </font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>ROY&nbsp;WILSON, Compiler (<em>Praxis</em>)</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Roy Wilson (dubbed &quot;the Australian master of the Ximenean grid&quot;) left school at the age of 15 and started an electrical trades apprenticeship. He worked in this field for over 30 years until injury forced early retirement in 1980. Roy said that aspects of his life, previously taken for granted, altered radically as a result of his early retirement. With golf a passion from youth now off the agenda, his energies turned to less physically demanding pursuits, like cryptic crosswords. Roy had been doing cryptics almost as long as he had been playing golf, but now, he tried his hand at setting them. A most stimulating exercise! Roy has always had a love of music, literature, movies and the arts in general. Happily, he finds many cryptic setters have a similar bent. Shirley and Roy have been married for 44 years and have two married sons who, in turn, have 2 sons each.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>DAVID STICKLEY, former 'Gridman' of the ACC and compiler.</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">David Stickley, the former 'gridman' of the ACC, considers himself very lucky. After spending 12 years as a computer specialist in Sydney, he now works from home generating 13 crosswords a week for various newspapers and magazines. His wife, Linda, has recently left work to help him run the business which is growing steadily. David enjoys taking an active role in the raising of his children and, until recently, did most of the cooking and housework. David recently became the first Australian to have a cryptic crossword published in the New York Times. Looking ahead, David hopes that crosswords remain popular, especially among the younger generations who have many other things to distract them. To this end, he is developing an evening college course to teach people how to attempt cryptic crosswords.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>CATHERINE HAMBLING, compiler (<em>Cha-Cha</em>)</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Catherine's childhood was spent in various parts of South Queensland. She went to school at St Hilda's in Southport where she first took an interest in crosswords. With her friend they would snaffle the class newspaper and do the crossword instead of prep. Catherine says: &quot;Maybe that misspent youth accounts for a lot of things!&quot; In 1950 she went to work at RBH as a lab technician. After marriage and a couple of years in Canberra she returned to Brisbane with a baby son and eventually acquired a daughter and another son. By 1968 when she returned to work in a private pathology lab, the daily papers were publishing English cryptics. Catherine was hooked and managed to spread her addiction to several others (like all good pushers!). With the help of the lab photocopier they would try to beat each other to finish the day's puzzle. In 1980 her daughter was doing some work for a new paper TIME OFF. She suggested that Catherine compose cryptics for it. Catherine was horrified but managed some simple ones. At $10 a puzzle she didn't see it as a career move! Soon after she retired from the lab in 1989 a journalist friend decided that composing cryptics was exceedingly clever (Catherine was not about to disillusion her!). Her piece appeared in the Sunday Mail and she was contacted by several Brisbane members including Shirl O'Brien. Catherine immediately joined the Australian Crossword Club and the rest, as they say, is history.</font></p>
