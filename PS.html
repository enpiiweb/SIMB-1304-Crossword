				<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">PATRICK STREET, President and
                Foundation Member of the Australian Crossword Club.</font></b></p>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Patrick has been involved with crosswords for many years. 
                    His love affair with cryptics began in the 1960s. He joined Alan Eason’s <i>Crossworder</i> magazine in 1988. 
                    He was a Foundation member of the Australian Crossword Club when it started in May 1990 and in February 1992 
                    Patrick was privileged to be appointed by the Executive Committee the ACC President and has continued in that 
                    role for more than 20 years. He has contributed several crosswords to <i>Crozworld</i> mainly of an unorthodox nature. 
                    He took on the challenge of Adjudication of the Slots 1-5 puzzles for ten years. In June 2000 Patrick was appointed 
                    to the important role of editor and publisher of the ACC’s monthly magazine <i>Crozworld</i> and has continued 
                    this essential undertaking since then. Patrick also carried out the role of Puzzle Set-up person for many years 
                    before passing the baton to the indispensable Ian Williams. The ACC is a thriving Club catering for theunique 
                    interests of cruciverbalists throughout Australia. The valued members of the ACC are dedicated solvers and lovers 
                    of crosswords and quizzes and it is hoped that <i>Crozworld</i> can continue to provide this essential service 
                    to the members of the ACC for many years into thefuture.</font>
