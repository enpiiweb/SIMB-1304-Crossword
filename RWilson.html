					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Roy Wilson (dubbed &quot;the Australian master of the Ximenean grid&quot;) left school at the age of 15 and started an electrical trades apprenticeship. He worked in this field for over 30 years until injury forced early retirement in 1980. Roy said that aspects of his life, previously taken for granted, altered radically as a result of his early retirement. With golf a passion from youth now off the agenda, his energies turned to less physically demanding pursuits, like cryptic crosswords. Roy had been doing cryptics almost as long as he had been playing golf, but now, he tried his hand at setting them. A most stimulating exercise! Roy has always had a love of music, literature, movies and the arts in general. Happily, he finds many cryptic setters have a similar bent. Shirley and Roy have been married for 44 years and have two married sons who, in turn, have 2 sons each.</font></p>
