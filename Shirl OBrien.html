					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Shirl O'Brien has always loved words and word games and always did crossword puzzles but was never 'grabbed' by them until The Courier-Mail started publishing first The Times, then soon after The Guardian puzzles in 1979. She was hooked! Five years later Shirl was wanting to find Aussie puzzles and in desperation tried her hand at compiling them. She approached The Courier-Mail and sold four puzzles on trial; that was seventeen years ago! Shirl has now compiled more than 860 crosswords for The Courier-Mail and seven for The Guardian. She chose the name 'Southern Cross' because her initials begin with SO. Shirl states that the name has 'unashamedly Aussie connections', and the 'Cross' of crossword is there. In The Guardian she uses the name Auster - the south wind. Shirl's husband Jack is doing a goodly number of grids for her these days. Incidentally the July 2001 Slot-3 was published originally on Shirl and Jack's 50th wedding anniversary (the golden theme). Shirl says: &quot;I love Crozworld and all the friends it has generated for me, even those I haven't met.&quot;</font></p>
