						<p><font face="Arial">The Australian Crossword Club accepts electronically-transmitted entries for the competitions for its primary puzzles (Slots 1-5). Such entries are not to be sent to the nominated Adjudicator for the month, but to <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Ian Williams</st1:PersonName> whose e-mail address is:</font></p>
						<p align="center"><a href="mailto:%20ianw@webone.com.au"><font face="Arial">ianw@webone.com.au</font></a></p>
						<p><font face="Arial">E-lodgement saves postage costs and avoids postal delays and non-delivery. It can also give you a receipt for the delivery of the e-mail message. And there&rsquo;s more! It can even help you proof-read your solutions.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial">The Closing time for e-submissions is the same time as for postal entries on the date published each month in <i>Crozworld.</i></font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial">AxWord or its &ldquo;lite&rdquo; version AxWordB is sufficient to enable crosswords to be prepared in a convenient, transmissible and transportable form.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">You can purchase AxWord from Doug Butler at $50.00 (special Club price). Mention this website and 25% of the purchase price will be donated to the ACC Website Maintenance Fund</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">Or download this cut-down version, AxWordB, which has all the requisites for editing, saving and printing grids and preparing solutions for e-submission (it just doesn&rsquo;t have the wordlists and search facilities of the full thing). It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to re-install the program if your version is a month or two old. Minor improvements are being made all the time, and some of them may be of benefit to YOU!</font></p>

						<p><font face="Arial">You'll find the program really easy to use, and there's plenty of help files so you can get the most out of it. If anything doesn't work the way it should, contact Doug 'Mr AxWord' at</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial"><b>Preparing crosswords for e-lodgement</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">Crosswords for e-lodgement can be prepared using <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Doug Butler</st1:PersonName>&rsquo;s AxWord. You can download a &quot;light&quot; version of AxWord from the link in Doug&rsquo;s article above. This version is sufficient to enable anyone to prepare crosswords in a convenient and transportable form. It has all the requisites for composing on screen, printing and saving, etc. - it just doesn't have the word lists and search capabilities of the full version of Axword.&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">To e-lodge, you can simply attach a file or files prepared from the solutions you have completed in AxWord as follows:&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">Having previously entered and saved (in C:\Program files\Axword, or any other directory in which you wish to save the puzzles) each of the puzzles that you wish to submit, start AxWord. In the AxWord search page click on &ldquo;File&rdquo; and &quot;Batch Functions&quot; and navigate to the directory containing the solved puzzles. Assemble the list of 5, or however many solutions you want to submit, by highlighting the file name and clicking on &quot;Add to Batch&quot;. Select &ldquo;Make file Desktop\temp.xwd&rdquo; from the drop-down list on the left of the Batch Functions pane [the first option is &ldquo;Print Solutions 3 wide&rdquo;] and click on &quot;Run Batch&quot; All of the solutions you have selected will now be included in the file temp.xwd, which will be placed automatically on your Desktop.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">In your e-mail program, commence a new e-mail to <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Ian Williams</st1:PersonName> (<a href="mailto:%20ianw@webone.com.au">ianw@webone.com.au</a>) and attach it to the e-mail. Alternatively, copy the file from the Desktop and attach it to the e-mail message by pasting. If you wish to receive blank grids for each month&rsquo;s puzzles, e-mail Ian and ask to be included on the distribution list. More comprehensive advice is included with the monthly e-mail to help you process and find the relevant file(s) and attach them.</font></p>
