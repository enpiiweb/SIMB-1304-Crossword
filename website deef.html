						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Well done! <i>David Stickley</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>The website is fantastic! I am really impressed. Who is responsible for that? It is just great. I was very surprised to see that old crossword of mine there; I hardly remember it. <i>Carole Noble</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Took a butchers at the front page. Looked pretty good (though I'm agnostic about the mobile Map!) Followed a few of the links (to the COMPENDIA) and the puzzles looked very good (clues could be less spaced out I thought but a trifling criticism). All in all it looks like it will soon be a HUGE asset to the Club and a credit to its 'Onlie Begetter'. <i>Doug Butler</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>CONGRATULATIONS ON THE WEB SITE! It is great to have one especially for the club. I am sure it will grow as time goes on. I was pleased to see AxWord included. I thought the Crossword of the Month far too easy and not really representative of the standard of those in <i>Crozworld</i>. <i>Audrey Ryan</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>I have just been viewing the new Website and just love it. You have done a terrific job, congratulations! It is extremely user friendly, and I'm sure that many people will enjoy it. <i>Rosemary Wenham</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Congratulations on the new website. You are a wizard. Its construction is beyond my comprehension but I think it's fabulous, attractive, informative and user-friendly. Cheers! <i>Brian Symons</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>The new web site looks terrific. You're a man of many talents, Patrick, and I'm looking forward to keeping in touch with the site. <i>Jim Colles</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Had a good look around the new web site - liked what I saw very much. Congratulations! <i>Bruce Austin</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>I love the new site. Best wishes. <i>Derek Harrison</i> The Crossword Centre www.crossword.org.uk</b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>I just surfed the website and you have done a tremendous job! The site has an excellent theme and heck what could I say to spruce it up? Nothing! First class effort Pat, you should be a programmer. <i>Leigh Zucal</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Wow, congratulations on a wonderful website for the Club! I must admit I hadn't even realised it was in the pipeline - you really have done an excellent job and I'm sure it will attract many new members. Very 'user-friendly' and quite dynamic-looking. I really couldn't suggest any improvements as I think you have covered everything. Well done!!!  </b><b><i>Daphne Titus-Rees</i></b></font>
						<li type="square"><b><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I went to the site for the first time this evening, and I must say that it is a great piece of work. Well done, Patrick! It's a very attractive, professional looking site. How do you ever get the time? For this I'm clueless!  <i>Ian Brown</i></font></b>
